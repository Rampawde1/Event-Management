        # can specify which OS this VM should run on.

        # of ubuntu

            # The idea is that the VM can access your remote repository
            # because your repository is an sfdx project.
            # This is a default action that allows us to enter the root 
            # directory of the repository

            # Make sure to specify fetch-depth:0. This allows us to
            # access previous commits that have been pushed to the repository.

            # We'll need this later when we try to figure out which metadata has 
            # changed between commits, so that we can only deploy that metadata
